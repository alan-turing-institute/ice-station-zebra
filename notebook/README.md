# Notebooks Overview

Notebooks 0, 1, and 2 include the following versions of IceNet:

- **UNet TensorFlow version**
- **PyTorch UNet version**
- **PyTorch CGAN version**

These notebooks are based on and combined from the following GitHub repositories (IceNet):
- [eds-book-gallery](https://github.com/eds-book-gallery/67a1e320-7c47-4ea9-8df8-e868326bc90b/tree/main)
- [icenet-notebooks](https://github.com/icenet-ai/icenet-notebooks)

Maria combined two different GitHub repositories (listed above), downloaded the necessary data (which required some setup), set up the environment from scratch, and edited and combined the scripts (with small modifications to the code) to ensure they ran successfully on Baskerville. Additional machine learning models are currently being developed and will be added in the future.
